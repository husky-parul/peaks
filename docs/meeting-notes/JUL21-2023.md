## Meeting Notes

### AGENDA 21-JUL-2023

- Roadmap

    - Continue upstream development using Trimaran schduler plugin design for PEAKS
    - Scheduling Algorithm 
    - Propose KEP for PEAKS


- Scheduling Algorithm:
    - What will be the Metrics Source? Do we inject Kepler metrics into Prometheus or add interface to inject Kepler metrics directly?
        - Currently load watcher provides kube metrics and Prometheus. 
        - Kepler -> Prom -> load watcher -> PEAKS
            
    - How are we going to optimize for power consumption?
        - Node Utilization 
    

    - What metrics are use going to use?

    - Output for the year
        - Document the methodology how do we learn the curve
        - Get the experimental environment (Use set up Chen's 4 nodes + k8s)
        - Define the scoring function/ What resources we are including
        - Provide the evidence of the performance of the scoring function

## Next Steps

Algo of scoring function
    (shared on recording)

Getting data from : Kepler -> Prom -> load watcher -> trimaran (peaks)
    - extend load-watcher to get kepler metrics from Prometheus (Chen)
    - Figure out the design and implementation later

### Updates

- [Manifest](https://github.com/husky-parul/peaks/tree/trimaran/manifests)

- Env set up done using:
    - Kind
    - Trimaran deployed
    - Load watcher deployed
    - Pod is scheduled by trimaran as seen in trimaran logs


- Issue

Trimaran is not able to connect to the load-watcher. Error in trimaran log:

``` sh
"Load watcher client failed" err="Get \"http://load-watcher.kube-system.svc.cluster.local:2020/watcher\": dial tcp: 
lookup load-watcher.kube-system.svc.cluster.local on [2001:4860:4860::8844]:53: 
read udp [fc00:f853:ccd:e793::2]:43472->[2001:4860:4860::8844]:53: i/o timeout"
```
> I tested by  curl http://load-watcher.kube-system.svc.cluster.local:2020/watcher from inside another container and the response was coming so it means that load-watcher service is up. 

``` sh
{"timestamp":1689891143,"window":{"duration":"15m","start":1689890242,"end":1689891142},"source":"Prometheus","data":{"NodeMetricsMap":{}}}/
```
> Thing to note here is that NodeMetricsMap is empty in the response
